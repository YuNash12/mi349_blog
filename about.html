    <h2> About Me</h2>
    <img src="picofme.png" alt="Picture of Yusuf Nashif" style="width:200px;height:270px;">
    <p> My name is Yusuf Nashif and I am a Senior in Information Science. I am a motivated student hoping to make a difference in the world by educating individuals about the importance of privacy and cybersecurity. Through my studies and experiences, I have gained skills in IT, cybersecurity, and digital problem-solving, which I aim to apply in meaningful ways. Currently, I have an internship with TechSmith, where I work as a Customer Care intern. My dream is to one day own a business that focuses on creating and providing necessary and effective anti-virus software that protects vulnerable individuals from harmful attacks online. </p>

    <p> Outside of my work, I enjoy playing video games, listening to music, baking, rock-climbing, and I find excitement in trying new things! I enjoy rock climbing because it combines physical activity with strategic problem-solving by pushing me to think carefully about each move while utilizing my strength and endurance. Listening to music and baking are hobbies that I find therapeutic, and I often rely on them when I need to relieve stress in a less physically demanding form. </p>

    <p>In terms of video games, I play a bunch! <strong> Here are a few of the games I enjoy with friends that help me relieve some stress: </strong> </p>
        <ul>
    <li>Dead by Daylight</li>
    <li>Valorant</li>
    <li>PEAK</li>
    <li>Clash Royale</li>
    <li>Call of Duty Mobile</li>
    <li>Minecraft</li>
    <li>Overwatch 2</li>
    <li>Grand Theft Auto 5</li>
    <li>Phasmophobia</li>
    <li>Stardew Valley</li>
    <li>Content Warning</li>
    <li>Tetris</li>
</ul>

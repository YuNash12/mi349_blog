                Imagine being unable to maintain eye contact with individuals in your everyday life, missing job opportunities because interview interactions feel overwhelmingly daunting, or facing intense anxiety talking to friends and family. 
                The experiences of over 24 million people around the globe living with schizophrenia often include difficulties with emotional regulation and social interactions that make day-to-day situations frightening and stressful. 
                Virtual Reality, commonly referred to as VR, offers a groundbreaking approach that addresses the challenges individuals with schizophrenia face each day. By providing immersive and safe environments where people can feel both present and welcome, VR enables those living with schizophrenia to practice social interactions while also building confidence without the pressures of real-world consequences. 
                Recognizing and understanding how VR can support people living with schizophrenia is essential because it offers an innovative and accessible solution to symptoms that millions of individuals are affected by daily. 
                Virtual Reality has gained significant traction within mental health research as a method of treatment for various psychological conditions.

            <p>
                By providing the potential to create and engage with a multitude of different environments and situations that may be accessed anywhere with a VR headset, individuals who are impacted by diverse psychological conditions are given outlets to understand and navigate their symptoms in controlled, immersive settings that facilitate skill development and therapeutic intervention. 
                Over the last few decades, VR-based therapy has been widely explored for the effectiveness it demonstrates in treating PTSD, anxiety, and social impairments, many of which overlap with symptoms that individuals with schizophrenia commonly experience. 
                However, although recent research has exhibited promising results following the usage of VR-based therapy, questions regarding its long-term effectiveness and its ability to maintain symptom reduction over time remain unanswered.

            <h2>Navigating AI and Its Dual Impacts on Social Media</h2>

                The impact AI produces on social media is immense and works in shaping both user experiences and platforms as a whole. Although Artificial Intelligence offers and provides innovative tools that permit benefits such as personalized content and increased accessibility for those with impairments, it also introduces significant challenges. 
                Misinformation, disinformation, bias, and privacy concerns have become increasingly prevalent as AI algorithms shape the way information is shared and viewed on social media platforms. 
                However, addressing the issues that AI presents through education and policy development can help fully harness Artificial Intelligence’s potential while minimizing its negative impacts. 
                Therefore, although it may be used as a vessel for misinformation, disinformation, and other negative purposes, AI has the potential to enhance online experiences and benefit both users and platforms through proper education and clear regulations.

                LLMs are advanced algorithms that can analyze and produce text based on larger sets of data that are similar to humans. Large Language Models, such as the popular AI model ChatGPT, are capable of mimicking human language, which makes them powerful tools for the generation of content. 
                However, LLMs are only able to create content based on the data they are given, and as a result, can sometimes output false or misleading information, such as factual inaccuracies and AI-generated hallucinations (information produced by AI that is made up, but is completely false). 
                Therefore, education and public awareness about how to identify what information is false can strengthen individuals’ capabilities to make more informed decisions online, which reduces the overall spread of misinformation.
